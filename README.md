**35+** bindings · **tmux 1.9 to 3.5** · **vim aware** · **77** tests · **95%+** coverage

Pane navigation, resizing, splits that keep the current directory, and window movement, the conventions almost everyone hand-rolls, as a perfected superset of [tmux-pain-control](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-pain-control). Every binding is gated to the tmux versions that support it, so the same plugin runs cleanly on every tmux TPM supports, from 1.9 up. Any key can be turned off to avoid a conflict, and an optional smart `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` coexists with [vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator).

Built from [tmux-plugin-template](https://github.com/tmux-revamped/tmux-plugin-template).

<td><strong>Conflict-free</strong><br>Any key can be disabled through one option, so it never fights another plugin or your own bindings.</td>
<td><strong>Vim friendly</strong><br>Prefixed nav coexists with vim-tmux-navigator, and an optional smart `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` adds split-aware navigation.</td>

## Bindings

All keys are pressed after the prefix.

## Install

With [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), add to `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'tmux-revamped/tmux-pain-control-revamped'
```

Then press `prefix + I` to install.

Manual install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-revamped/tmux-pain-control-revamped ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-pain-control-revamped
run-shell ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-pain-control-revamped/pain-control-revamped.tmux
```

## Configuration

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `@pane_resize` | `5` | cells each resize binding moves |
| `@new_window_path` | `true` | new window opens in the current path; set `false` for the default behavior |
| `@pane_control_sync_key` | `S` | key that toggles `synchronize-panes` |
| `@pane_control_disabled_keys` | empty | space or comma separated keys to leave unbound, for example `"c <"` |
| `@pane_control_vim_navigation` | `off` | set `on` for prefixless `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` and `Ctrl+\` pane and vim-split navigation |
| `@pane_control_vim_pattern` | the vim-family regex | the process pattern that marks a pane as running vim; override for a wrapped or renamed editor |
| `@pane_control_no_wrap` | `off` | set `on` so pane selection stops at the edge instead of wrapping to the far side (tmux 2.6+) |
| `@pane_control_pane_titles` | `off` | set `on` to show pane titles in the pane border (tmux 2.3+) |
| `@pane_control_smart_split_key` | `*` | key for the longer-axis smart split |

| `@pane_control_break_key` | `!` | key that breaks the current pane to its own window |
| `@pane_control_swap_prev_key` | `{` | key that swaps the pane with the previous |
| `@pane_control_swap_next_key` | `}` | key that swaps the pane with the next |
| `@pane_control_promote_key` | `+` | key that promotes the pane to the main slot |
| `@pane_control_mark_key` | `m` | key that marks a pane (tmux 2.1+) |
| `@pane_control_swap_mark_key` | `=` | key that swaps the current pane with the marked one (tmux 2.1+) |

| `@pane_control_respawn_key` | `R` | key that respawns the pane after a confirm |
| `@pane_control_pane_name_key` | `P` | key that prompts for a pane title (tmux 2.6+) |
| `@pane_control_capture_key` | `C` | key that prompts to save the scrollback to a file |
| `@pane_control_scratch_key` | `g` | key that opens the scratch popup (tmux 3.2+) |

## Working with vim-tmux-navigator

The prefixed `h/j/k/l` here and the prefixless `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` of vim-tmux-navigator live in different key tables and never collide, so the two are complementary: keep using both. To stop running vim-tmux-navigator's tmux side, set `@pane_control_vim_navigation 'on'` and this plugin provides the same prefixless `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` plus `Ctrl+\` for the previous pane, with the same `is_vim` process check, so the same chord moves your vim split when vim is focused and the tmux pane otherwise. The `is_vim` pattern is overridable through `@pane_control_vim_pattern`, matching vim-tmux-navigator's `@vim_navigator_pattern`. This needs tmux 2.4 or newer and binds the chords without a prefix, which shadows `Ctrl+l` clear-screen, so it stays off by default.

This replaces only the tmux half of vim-tmux-navigator. The Neovim or Vim half, the in-editor keymaps, is a Vim plugin and still belongs in your editor config.

## Compatibility

Works on every tmux version TPM supports, 1.9 and up, on Linux (x86_64 and arm64) and macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon). Newer operations are gated to the versions that support them: the marked-pane swap needs 2.1, pane titles need 2.6, edge no-wrap selection needs 2.6, the promote-to-main token needs 3.0, and the scratch popup needs 3.2. Below tmux 2.3 the full-width and full-height splits fall back to normal splits; below 3.1 the binding description notes are omitted; the optional smart navigation needs 2.4 for the copy-mode table. Each gated binding is simply omitted on older tmux; nothing errors.

## Development

```bash
make test    # bats suite
make lint    # shellcheck
make coverage  # kcov line coverage on Linux
```

The decision logic lives in [`src/lib/pain/pain.sh`](src/lib/pain/pain.sh) as pure, seam-backed helpers, and the applier in [`src/pain.sh`](src/pain.sh) runs under a dry-run mode so the full binding matrix is validated without a live tmux.

## The tmux-revamped family

This plugin is one member of the tmux-revamped family. Every member carries the
same contract in [`FAMILY.md`](FAMILY.md), the same tooling under `family/`, and
the same shared library, all held byte-identical by a checksum manifest. They are
built to be installed together: no member claims a key or a tmux option that
another member claims.

A defect found in one member is hunted across all of them before the fix is
called done. That obligation is written into the contract rather than left to
memory, and `family/bin/sweep` is how it is discharged.

### Checking an installation

With every member on disk, one command reports any conflict between them:

```sh
family/bin/doctor --live
```

It reads each member and the running tmux server, and reports duplicate keys,
duplicate status placeholders, options outside the naming grammar, and any
member whose contract version has fallen behind.
