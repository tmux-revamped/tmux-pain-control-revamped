## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Pane navigation (h/j/k/l and C-h/j/k/l), repeatable resizing with a
  configurable step, splits that keep the current directory including the
  default `"` and `%` keys, new window in the current path, repeatable window
  move, and a synchronize-panes toggle.
- Version gating for tmux 1.9 and up: full splits use `-f` on 2.3+, the
  copy-mode table is used on 2.4+, and binding description notes on 3.1+.
- Configurable keys and an `@pane_control_disabled_keys` option so any binding
  can be turned off to avoid a conflict.
- Optional prefixless Ctrl+h/j/k/l navigation that detects vim with the standard
  is_vim check, off by default, to coexist with or replace vim-tmux-navigator.
